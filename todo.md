## image-colour

A simple tool for automating the selection of a random wallpaper and adjusting
hyprland config to update accent colours to match those in wallpaper palette.

### TODO:
-[x] basic refactor
  -[] refactor into app struct

-[] less opinionated
  -[x] switch from existing "template" config file to user's own config
  -[x] create backup of user's config
  -[x] modify user's config without being intrusive
  -[] new problem:
      once we have autogenerated a config file -- when we move to autogenerate a NEW config
      for the 2nd, 3rd, etc time..
      the config file will already have our extra rules appended to the end
      and will then append a second set of extra rules to the end
      -[] solution?: we need to add a stamp w/ unique identifier before (and after)
          the generated lines so we can detect if they are already present and IF SO
          we should overwrite those previously generated rules

-[] package executable and test

-[] IMPORTANT: hyprland config allow for multiple config files
  -[] don't have to overwrite main default config so much
  -[] simply create a colors.conf and borders.conf and load those as sources?
